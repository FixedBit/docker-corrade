# Corrade Docker Build Script
[![Docker Hub Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/fixedbit/corrade?style=plastic)](https://hub.docker.com/r/fixedbit/corrade)


This area will be filled in more later but the gist of it is...

1) Open Terminal
2) Type: `./build.sh`
3) ... success?

This uses my docker build script with some defaults filled in.

Feel free to fork this and even do PRs!
